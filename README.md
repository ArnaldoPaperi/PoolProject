Simple pool game test

This is a simple game I have been working on to learn basic unity concept.
It's still work in progress.
To start, hit play.
The power to hit the ball is showcased by the lines colours (green will barely touch it, red is a strong hit).
If you loose the white ball, press "Space" to respawn (there will be a message in the console indicating when you loose it)
